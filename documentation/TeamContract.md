# Teamwork Contract

Project Name: TBD

### Team Member:

Darwin Zhang, Marco Wang, Tianhao Cao, Yusen Huang

### 1. Work Distribution & Roles

-   **Equitable Distribution:** Work is pulled from the **Sprint Backlog** and No one "assigns" tasks; members volunteer for tickets during Sprint Planning.

-   **The Scrum Lead (Rotation):** We will rotate the Scrum Lead role weekly.

    -   *Responsibility:* Facilitate weekly Stand-ups, communicate with stakeholders, track team members progress, and ensure the kanban board is up to date.

        Sprint 2 Lead: Darwin

        Sprint 3 Lead: Marco

        Sprint 4 Lead: Tianhao

        Sprint 5 Lead: Yusen

-   **Code Review:** Whenever someone uploads the code, the Scrum Lead should review the code. If it is the Scrum Lead himself who uploads the code, the next week's Scrum Lead shall review the code of current Scrum Lead.

### 2. Time & Availability

-   **Core Hours:** Everyone is expected to be online and responsive on Slack/Discord between **2:00 PM – 8:00 PM PST during weekday**, and between **2:00 PM - 11:59 PM on due day.**

-   **Off-grid:** Evenings (after 10:00 PM) and Sunday (Except when it's due day) are "Dark Zones" (no responses expected) to prevent burnout.

-   **Code Uploads:** Code must be pushed to a branch before 8:00 PM everyday so that the Scrum Lead has enough time to complete code Review.

### 3. Communication & Logistics

-   **Stand-up:** Written summary in the group chat at **2:00 PM from Tuesday to Due day**.

    -   *Format:* 1) What I did yesterday; 2) What I’m doing today; 3) Any blockers.

-   **Weekly Sprint Meeting:** Monday at 4:00 PM via Zoom for Sprint Review/Planning.

-   **Weekly Stakeholder Meeting:** Friday via zoom for presenting weekly progress with Stakeholders

-   **Communication Channel:** Slacks

-   **Documentation:** Documentation is done by Scrum Lead and will be stored in Github Repo. What to document: Weekly Meeting Agenda and minutes, daily stand-up content, updating all necessary logs.

### 4. Style of Working

-   **Sprint Deadlines:** We operate in 1-week Sprints. All "Definition of Done" criteria must be met by Due day at 11:59 PM.

-   **Hackathons:** We will hold a 3-hour "Co-working/Pair Programming" session every Due day afternoon to tackle complex bugs together.

### 5. Quality & Definition of Done (DoD)

Every piece of work must meet these standards:

-   Passes all tests.

-   Passes a peer code review.

-   Documentation is updated.

-   **Code of Conduct:** We prioritize "Psychological Safety." No question is too "basic." Passive-aggressive comments in code reviews are unacceptable.
